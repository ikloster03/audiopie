# Welcome to AudioPie

**AudioPie** is a desktop application for creating M4B audiobooks from MP3 audio tracks with comprehensive chapter editing capabilities.

## What is AudioPie?

AudioPie is a powerful yet easy-to-use tool that allows you to:

- 🎵 **Convert MP3 to M4B** — Transform your collection of MP3 files into a single M4B audiobook
- 📖 **Edit Chapters** — Create, rename, reorder, and merge chapters with drag & drop
- 🎨 **Manage Metadata** — Edit book title, author, genre, description, and cover art
- 💾 **Save Projects** — Save your work and continue later
- 🌍 **Multilingual** — Available in English and Russian

## Why M4B Format?

The M4B format is the gold standard for audiobooks because it:

- ✅ Supports chapter navigation
- ✅ Remembers your playback position
- ✅ Works with all major audiobook players (Apple Books, Audiobookshelf, etc.)
- ✅ Provides better compression than MP3
- ✅ Supports cover art and rich metadata
